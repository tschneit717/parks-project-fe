      This application is something I made in Svelte and utilizing Tailwind for all styling. It's a simple road trip planner that uses the Bing Maps API to calculate the distance between two National Parks. This is a work in progress, and I'm hoping to add more features in the future. The purpose of this project is to learn Svelte, the Bing Maps API, and Java Spring Boot.
