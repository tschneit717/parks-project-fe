	<p>This is the FE application for the Parks Project that I am working on.</p>

	<p>
		The back end is built in Java on a MySQL database and is using Bing Maps api for directions and
		information, because honestly ain't nobody can write all that. Future features include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>User sign up and profile pages</li>
		<li>Bing Maps integration</li>
		<li>User's maps search history can be saved and shared</li>
		<li>Park information pages</li>
	</ul>
